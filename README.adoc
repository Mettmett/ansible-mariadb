== Goals

Little Ansible role to install MariaDB server from official repos, with a custom (and simple) configuration.

== Vars

One variable is used in the file `main.yml`. Change the value of `mariadb_version` to use other version (default = 10.5)

== How to use it ?

=== Test it with molecule

Simple ! Use the venv.sh script to enter to the matrix (c).

[source, bash]
----
source venv.sh
----

This virtualenv will bring you needed tools. You will in the virtualenv automatically. You are now ready to create virtual machines.

[source, bash]
----
molecule create
----

And then use the playbook and launch the tests

[source, bash]
----
molecule converge && molecule verify
----

When you're all set, destroy it.

[source, bash]
----
molecule destroy
----

=== Use this role in another ansible playbook

Incorpore this role on your playbook, in the file `requirements.yml` and go !

[source, bash]
